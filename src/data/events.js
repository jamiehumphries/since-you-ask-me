      the generation above him served in the [war](#war), so can’t be said to have never stood up for anything that mattered.

      The auditioner does compliment Jerry’s ability to write [lyrics that scan](#lyrics-that-scan), but still sends him away.

      Uncle Newt is able to tell her that [Susanna Noone](@susanna-noone) was indeed her mother, despite Vanessa’s resemblance to [Aunt Gally](@gally-nightingale).

      He does go on to say that Gally would have loved to have been Vanessa’s mother, and that,
      really, she was one of her two mothers in every meaningful sense.

      When Vanessa asks what her father looked liked, Newt only says that he never met [Major Noone](@basil-noone).

      Newt is reluctant to do so. In his life generally, Newt has no interest in the required activity and never intends to try it.
      He remarks that there are other ways of achieving the same effect.

      At this point, Gally begins to speak more plainly.
      She had particularly hoped that Newt would do this for them, so that the kid would be the closest possible thing to being Gally’s own child.

      This convinces Newt and they agree to the plan. He asks to be part of the child’s life in the role of an uncle.

      Gally begins to explain the practicalities of the arrangement by asking if Newt knows Crewe.
