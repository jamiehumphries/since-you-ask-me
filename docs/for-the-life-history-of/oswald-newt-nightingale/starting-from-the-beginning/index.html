      Patrick refutes the idea, saying that Oswald should have taken better care of his hat.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, Mr. James seizes Patrick’s hat and rips it.
      The family laughs as Patrick then rips Mr. James’ hat and Gally rips her mother’s one.</p><p>Patrick describes this round of hat ripping as “fun in its proper place”.</p><p>As the laughter dies down, Gally <a href="/for-a-tale-of/dogs/starting-from-the-beginning">tells Oswald to let their dog, Toby, out</a>.</p><p>At the end of the meal, Patrick reveals to the children that Mr. James is known for his <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories/starting-from-the-beginning">ghost stories</a>,
