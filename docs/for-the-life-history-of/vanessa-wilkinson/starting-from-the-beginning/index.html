        <p>At <span class="active-tag">Vanessa</span>’s <a href="/for-a-tale-of/funerals/starting-from-the-beginning">funeral</a>, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> is surprised to find that <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Uncle Newt</a>
      is wearing the same <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-top-hat/starting-from-the-beginning">hat</a> as he wore to Myra’s wedding. Newt remarks that it is an awfully resilient thing.</p><p>Jerry’s daughter has just spoken to him to ensure that he will not do a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/poetry/starting-from-the-beginning">poem</a> at the funeral.
      When Uncle Newt hears this, he suggests that Jerry should do one for Newt’s own funeral, when the day comes.</p><p>Uncle Newt says that he would pay Jerry his fee for the poem in advance, except that ha’pennies are no longer produced.
      He reacts with mock outrage when Jerry suggests that he pay him a whole penny instead.</p><ul><li>Vanessa was about 74 years old when she died</li><li><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> is Vanessa’s son</li><li><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Newt</a> is Vanessa’s uncle</li></ul>
