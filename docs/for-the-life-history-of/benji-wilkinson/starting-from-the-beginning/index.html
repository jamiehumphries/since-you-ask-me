      Vanessa wins and immediately takes the hat from inside and rips it up.</p><p>She also gets a small plastic cowboy from the cracker, which she gives to her grandson, <span class="active-tag">Benji</span>.

      Vanessa <a href="/for-a-tale-of/walters-blindness/starting-from-the-beginning">indicates to Walter</a> that his cracker is on his side plate.
      Deborah wins, but questions if she has to rip up her hat. She asks if that tradition comes from them being <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jewish-lineage/starting-from-the-beginning">a bit Jewish</a>.</p><p>Hilla tells her that lighting the candles is because they are a bit Jewish, but that the hat ripping comes from the Wilkinson side.
      It transpires that the tradition dates back at least as far as Uncle Newt’s childhood.</p><p>Uncle Newt prepares to <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories/starting-from-the-beginning">tell the story</a> of why the family rip the hats, but he is interrupted by a kitchen timer.

      Hilla tries to change her meal choice to omelette, but the children are already rushing into the room and it is too late.</p><p>Jerry and the children play out a rehearsed chant in which he acts as The Keeper of the Cakes of Pan.
