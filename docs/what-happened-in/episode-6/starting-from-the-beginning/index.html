        <p><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/russ-golding/starting-from-the-beginning">Russ</a> returns home from fishing with his dad, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/cliff-golding/starting-from-the-beginning">Cliff</a>.</p><p>His daughter, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/toby/starting-from-the-beginning">Toby</a> is hostile to the idea of fishing and confronts him as he arrives in.
      Russ explains that he doesn’t actually use a hook, so all he is really doing is “fish feeding”.</p><p>After Toby leaves, Russ and <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/alex/starting-from-the-beginning">Alex</a> talk more about Russ’ pretend fishing.
      Apparently, Cliff doesn’t know that Russ deliberately doesn’t catch fish.
      He just thinks that Russ is bad at fishing, which he enjoys teasing him about.</p>

      Toby counts through the <em>One for Sorrow</em> rhyme, but she only knows it up to four.</p><p>Alex recites a version of the rhyme that goes well beyond the traditional seven,
      culminating in the revolution of the magpies and the beginning of the thousand year age of magpies.</p><p>With mock shame, Russ reveals to Tony that Alex used to be in a sketch group.</p>
