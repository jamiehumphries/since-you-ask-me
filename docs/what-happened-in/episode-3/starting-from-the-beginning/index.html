        <p>During his National Service with the British Army, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> visits a shop near to where he is posted in Germany.
      He meets <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/hilla-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Hilla</a>, who is working in the shop.</p><p>Jerry’s original reason for visiting the shop was to purchase a rubber stamp that could replicate a mark that he shows on his hand.
      This mark is to prove that he has completed a cross-country run, a task which he wishes to avoid in future.</p><p>Hilla says that her father could make the stamp, but questions why he should help a British soldier.
      When Jerry asks if this is because her father is still sore about losing the war, Hilla responds:
      “No, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/solomon-goldfarb/starting-from-the-beginning">Solomon Goldfarb</a> is <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jewish-lineage/starting-from-the-beginning">not sorry that Germany lost</a> the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/war/starting-from-the-beginning">war</a>.”</p><p>After more back-and-forth between the two, Jerry comes to the suggestion that he should save his money on the rubber stamp
      and instead buy tickets to the pictures for Hilla and him.</p>

      are helping <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> to sort out his things and clear space.</p><p>Jerry becomes unexpectedly upset when he realises that they have deflated his lilo.
      In his shock, he shouts: “What have you done? Oh, you cockers!”</p><p>He quickly regains his composure and apologises to them all.
      He explains that he was keeping the lilo blown up because his wife, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/hilla-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Hilla</a>, had been the one who inflated it before she died.</p><p>He consoles himself and the others with hugs and his refrain of <a href="/for-a-tale-of/half-a-glass/starting-from-the-beginning">“half a glass”</a>.</p><p>He apologises again for swearing at them.
      However, they are able to reassure him that his lingering <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jerrys-aphasia/starting-from-the-beginning">aphasia</a> has actually saved him from doing so.
      They comfort him by joking that “cockers” was at worst akin to “spaniels”, and agreeing that they had indeed behaved like “complete spaniels”.</p>
