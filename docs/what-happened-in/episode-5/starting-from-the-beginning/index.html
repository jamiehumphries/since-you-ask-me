        <p>The Nightingale family are celebrating Christmas with a family friend, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/montgomery-james/starting-from-the-beginning">Monty James</a>.</p><p><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/patrick-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Patrick</a> opens a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/christmas-crackers/starting-from-the-beginning">Christmas cracker</a>.
      He reads the joke, but sets his hat aside without putting it on.</p><p>His son, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Oswald</a>, and daughter, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/gally-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Gally</a>, both protest that he should wear the hat.
      Even his wife, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/lettie-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Lettie</a>, points out that Mr. James is wearing the hat that he won from his own cracker.
      Patrick is unmoved and does not wear his hat.</p><p><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Oswald</a> opens his cracker next and is excited to find a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/kazoos/starting-from-the-beginning">kazoo</a> inside.
      After requesting permission from his father, Oswald attempts to put on his own hat, but it rips as he is doing so.</p><p>Gally blames the rip on the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-large-head/starting-from-the-beginning">large size of Oswald’s head</a>, but suggests that Oswald should take their father’s unused hat.
      Patrick refutes the idea, saying that Oswald should have taken better care of his hat.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, Mr. James seizes Patrick’s hat and rips it.
      The family laughs as Patrick then rips Mr. James’ hat and Gally rips her mother’s one.</p><p>Patrick describes this round of hat ripping as “fun in its proper place”.</p><p>As the laughter dies down, Gally <a href="/for-a-tale-of/dogs/starting-from-the-beginning">tells Oswald to let their dog, Toby, out</a>.</p><p>At the end of the meal, Patrick reveals to the children that Mr. James is known for his <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories/starting-from-the-beginning">ghost stories</a>,
      and that he has kindly consented to tell them one now.</p>

      about the plans that she and <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/susanna-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Susanna</a> have to tour the country as a musical act.</p><p>Her parents are hesitant, but are somewhat reassured when Gally tells them that Susanna has recently married a <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/basil-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Captain Noone</a>
      and that he will be travelling with them.</p><p>Gally’s brother, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Newt</a>, has been on the sidelines of the discussion.
      When their parents withdraw to discuss the matter, Newt asks Gally more questions about Susanna’s supposed husband.</p><p>Newt deduces that <a href="/for-a-tale-of/vanessas-parentage/starting-from-the-beginning">Captain Noone is a ruse</a>.
      He tells Gally that the play on words with ‘no-one’ is not as subtle as she might think it is.</p><p>Gally tells him that it is too late to change the name from Noone, not least because she and Susanna are planning to rename their act
      ‘<a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Midnight & Noone</a>’.</p><p>The two discuss Gally’s new stage name of Midnight, agreeing that it is better suited than Nightingale given Gally’s low voice.
      This gives Newt <a href="/for-a-tale-of/woof-woof-woof/starting-from-the-beginning">an idea for a song</a> in which Gally would play the part of a man who impersonates birds.</p>

      by filling in for her at a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Midnight & Noone</a> performance in Leeds.
      She tells him that he will need to play the cello, but will only have one small bit of singing in the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/woof-woof-woof/starting-from-the-beginning">Albert Small song</a>.</p><p>Despite Newt’s protests, Gally insists that he must do this for her.
      Gally tells him that he can borrow her clothes, but he will need to buy himself a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-top-hat/starting-from-the-beginning">top hat</a>.
      (Presumably this is because <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-large-head/starting-from-the-beginning">his head would be too large</a> for Gally’s top hat.)</p><p>Newt is worried that the audience will be disappointed if they are expecting a male impersonator but get an actual man.

        <p>A stranger with a foreign accent approaches <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Newt</a> and addresses him as Mr. Nightingale.
      Newt asks if he had <a href="/for-a-tale-of/teaching/starting-from-the-beginning">taught</a> the man years ago.</p><p>The man tells him they have never met, but that he had always wanted to meet him.
      He then recites this short <a href="/for-a-tale-of/poetry/starting-from-the-beginning">poem</a>:</p><p><span class="inset">
        <em>
          I had a walrus as a pet.<br>
          Why I bought it, I forget.<br>
          I fed it kedgeree and rusks,<br>
          And used best Blanco on his tusks.
        </em>
      </span></p><p>From the style of the rhyme, Newt recognises it as something written by himself or <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a>.
      He remarks that animals and kings were their speciality.</p><p>Newt is gratified to hear that the man had remembered the verse for all these years and that it had “worked”.</p>

        <p>At <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/vanessa-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Vanessa</a>’s <a href="/for-a-tale-of/funerals/starting-from-the-beginning">funeral</a>, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> is surprised to find that <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Uncle Newt</a>
      is wearing the same <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-top-hat/starting-from-the-beginning">hat</a> as he wore to Myra’s wedding. Newt remarks that it is an awfully resilient thing.</p><p>Jerry’s daughter has just spoken to him to ensure that he will not do a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/poetry/starting-from-the-beginning">poem</a> at the funeral.
      When Uncle Newt hears this, he suggests that Jerry should do one for Newt’s own funeral, when the day comes.</p><p>Uncle Newt says that he would pay Jerry his fee for the poem in advance, except that ha’pennies are no longer produced.
      He reacts with mock outrage when Jerry suggests that he pay him a whole penny instead.</p>
