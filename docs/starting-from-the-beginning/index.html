      He reads the joke, but sets his hat aside without putting it on.</p><p>His son, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Oswald</a>, and daughter, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/gally-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Gally</a>, both protest that he should wear the hat.
      Even his wife, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/lettie-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Lettie</a>, points out that Mr. James is wearing the hat that he won from his own cracker.
      Patrick is unmoved and does not wear his hat.</p><p><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Oswald</a> opens his cracker next and is excited to find a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/kazoos/starting-from-the-beginning">kazoo</a> inside.
      After requesting permission from his father, Oswald attempts to put on his own hat, but it rips as he is doing so.</p><p>Gally blames the rip on the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-large-head/starting-from-the-beginning">large size of Oswald’s head</a>, but suggests that Oswald should take their father’s unused hat.
      Patrick refutes the idea, saying that Oswald should have taken better care of his hat.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, Mr. James seizes Patrick’s hat and rips it.
      The family laughs as Patrick then rips Mr. James’ hat and Gally rips her mother’s one.</p><p>Patrick describes this round of hat ripping as “fun in its proper place”.</p><p>As the laughter dies down, Gally <a href="/for-a-tale-of/dogs/starting-from-the-beginning">tells Oswald to let their dog, Toby, out</a>.</p><p>At the end of the meal, Patrick reveals to the children that Mr. James is known for his <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories/starting-from-the-beginning">ghost stories</a>,
      and that he has kindly consented to tell them one now.</p>

      about the plans that she and <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/susanna-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Susanna</a> have to tour the country as a musical act.</p><p>Her parents are hesitant, but are somewhat reassured when Gally tells them that Susanna has recently married a <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/basil-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Captain Noone</a>
      and that he will be travelling with them.</p><p>Gally’s brother, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Newt</a>, has been on the sidelines of the discussion.
      When their parents withdraw to discuss the matter, Newt asks Gally more questions about Susanna’s supposed husband.</p><p>Newt deduces that <a href="/for-a-tale-of/vanessas-parentage/starting-from-the-beginning">Captain Noone is a ruse</a>.
      He tells Gally that the play on words with ‘no-one’ is not as subtle as she might think it is.</p><p>Gally tells him that it is too late to change the name from Noone, not least because she and Susanna are planning to rename their act
      ‘<a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Midnight & Noone</a>’.</p><p>The two discuss Gally’s new stage name of Midnight, agreeing that it is better suited than Nightingale given Gally’s low voice.
      This gives Newt <a href="/for-a-tale-of/woof-woof-woof/starting-from-the-beginning">an idea for a song</a> in which Gally would play the part of a man who impersonates birds.</p>

      by filling in for her at a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Midnight & Noone</a> performance in Leeds.

      Gally tells him that he can borrow her clothes, but he will need to buy himself a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-top-hat/starting-from-the-beginning">top hat</a>.
      (Presumably, this is because <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-large-head/starting-from-the-beginning">his head would be too large</a> for Gally’s top hat.)</p><p>Newt is worried that the audience will be disappointed if they are expecting a male impersonator but get an actual man.

        <p>During his National Service with the British Army, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/jerry-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Jerry</a> visits a shop near to where he is posted in Germany.
      He meets <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/hilla-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Hilla</a>, who is working in the shop.</p><p>Jerry’s original reason for visiting the shop was to purchase a rubber stamp that could replicate a mark that he shows on his hand.
      This mark is to prove that he has completed a cross-country run, a task which he wishes to avoid in future.</p><p>Hilla says that her father could make the stamp, but questions why he should help a British soldier.
      When Jerry asks if this is because her father is still sore about losing the war, Hilla responds:
      “No, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/solomon-goldfarb/starting-from-the-beginning">Solomon Goldfarb</a> is <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jewish-lineage/starting-from-the-beginning">not sorry that Germany lost</a> the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/war/starting-from-the-beginning">war</a>.”</p><p>After more back-and-forth between the two, Jerry comes to the suggestion that he should save his money on the rubber stamp
      and instead buy tickets to the pictures for Hilla and him.</p>
