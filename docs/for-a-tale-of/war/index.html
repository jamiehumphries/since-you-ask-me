      He meets <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/hilla-wilkinson">Hilla</a>, who is working in the shop.</p><p>Jerry’s original reason for visiting the shop was to purchase a rubber stamp that could replicate a mark that he shows on his hand.
      This mark is to prove that he has completed a cross-country run, a task which he wishes to avoid in future.</p><p>Hilla says that her father could make the stamp, but questions why he should help a British soldier.
      When Jerry asks if this is because her father is still sore about losing the war, Hilla responds:
      “No, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/solomon-goldfarb">Solomon Goldfarb</a> is <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jewish-lineage">not sorry that Germany lost</a> the <span class="active-tag">war</span>.”</p><p>After more back-and-forth between the two, Jerry comes to the suggestion that he should save his money on the rubber stamp
      and instead buy tickets to the pictures for Hilla and him.</p>
