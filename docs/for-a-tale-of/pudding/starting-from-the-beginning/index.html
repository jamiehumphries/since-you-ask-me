She asks if that tradition comes from them being <a href="/for-a-tale-of/jewish-lineage/starting-from-the-beginning">a bit Jewish</a>.</p><p>Hilla tells her that lighting the candles is because they are a bit Jewish, but that the hat ripping comes from the Wilkinson side.
      It transpires that the tradition dates back at least as far as Uncle Newt’s childhood.</p><p>Uncle Newt prepares to <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories/starting-from-the-beginning">tell the story</a> of why the family rip the hats, but he is interrupted by a kitchen timer.
      Hilla bustles out of the room to fetch the <span class="active-tag">pudding</span>, enlisting help from <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/myra-wilkinson/starting-from-the-beginning">Myra</a>.</p>
