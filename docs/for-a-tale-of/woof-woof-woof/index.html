      Their hilarity grows as Russ sings in a high-pitched voice and explains that it is the nightingale doing dog impressions.</p><p>The lead singer resolves that they are doing the song.
      He dismisses the rest of the band except for Russ, to whom he says: “You and me are writing a song, <a href="/for-a-tale-of/russ-tattoo">Jawbone</a>.”</p>
