      by filling in for her at a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone">Midnight & Noone</a> performance in Leeds.

      (Presumably this is because <span class="active-tag">his head would be too large</span> for Gally’s top hat.)</p><p>Newt is worried that the audience will be disappointed if they are expecting a male impersonator but get an actual man.

      Even his wife, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/lettie-nightingale">Lettie</a>, points out that Mr. James is wearing the hat that he won from his own cracker.
      Patrick is unmoved and does not wear his hat.</p><p><a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale">Oswald</a> opens his cracker next and is excited to find a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/kazoos">kazoo</a> inside.
      After requesting permission from his father, Oswald attempts to put on his own hat, but it rips as he is doing so.</p><p>Gally blames the rip on the <span class="active-tag">large size of Oswald’s head</span>, but suggests that Oswald should take their father’s unused hat.
      Patrick refutes the idea, saying that Oswald should have taken better care of his hat.</p><p>Seeing an opportunity to lighten the mood, Mr. James seizes Patrick’s hat and rips it.
      The family laughs as Patrick then rips Mr. James’ hat and Gally rips her mother’s one.</p><p>Patrick describes this round of hat ripping as “fun in its proper place”.</p><p>As the laughter dies down, Gally <a href="/for-a-tale-of/dogs">tells Oswald to let their dog, Toby, out</a>.</p><p>At the end of the meal, Patrick reveals to the children that Mr. James is known for his <a href="/for-a-tale-of/stories">ghost stories</a>,
