      Hilla tries to change her meal choice to omelette, but the children are already rushing in to the room and it is too late.</p><p>Jerry and the children play out a rehearsed chant in which he acts as The Keeper of the Cakes of Pan.
      <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/myra-wilkinson">Myra</a> is The Flour Sifter, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/benji-wilkinson">Benji</a> is The Egg Man and <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/deborah-wilkinson">Deborah</a> is The Tosh Chronicler.</p><p>Hilla, still reading her book, doesn’t join in the chanting in her role as The Flipster.
      Benji begins to protest, but Jerry (still in character) defends The Flipster’s right to silence.</p><p>Although she doesn’t join the chanting this time, Hilla does not want her lines removed from the ritual. She likes it sometimes.</p>
