      When Uncle Newt hears this, he suggests that Jerry should do one for Newt’s own funeral, when the day comes.</p><p>Uncle Newt says that he would pay Jerry his fee for the poem in advance, except that ha’pennies are no longer produced.
      He reacts with mock outrage when Jerry suggests that he pay him a whole penny instead.</p>

      by filling in for her at a <a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone">Midnight & Noone</a> performance in Leeds.
      She tells him that he will need to play the cello, but will only have one small bit of singing in the <a href="/for-a-tale-of/woof-woof-woof">Albert Small song</a>.</p><p>Despite Newt’s protests, Gally insists that he must do this for her.
      Gally tells him that he can borrow her clothes, but he will need to buy himself a <span class="active-tag">top hat</span>.
      (Presumably, this is because <a href="/for-a-tale-of/newts-large-head">his head would be too large</a> for Gally’s top hat.)</p><p>Newt is worried that the audience will be disappointed if they are expecting a male impersonator but get an actual man.
