      about the plans that she and <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/susanna-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Susanna</a> have to tour the country as a musical act.</p><p>Her parents are hesitant, but are somewhat reassured when Gally tells them that Susanna has recently married a <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/basil-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Captain Noone</a>
      and that he will be travelling with them.</p><p>Gally’s brother, <a href="/for-the-life-history-of/oswald-newt-nightingale/starting-from-the-beginning">Newt</a>, has been on the sidelines of the discussion.
      When their parents withdraw to discuss the matter, Newt asks Gally more questions about Susanna’s supposed husband.</p><p>Newt deduces that <span class="active-tag">Captain Noone is a ruse</span>.
      He tells Gally that the play on words with ‘no-one’ is not as subtle as she might think it is.</p><p>Gally tells him that it is too late to change the name from Noone, not least because she and Susanna are planning to rename their act
      ‘<a href="/for-a-tale-of/midnight-and-noone/starting-from-the-beginning">Midnight & Noone</a>’.</p><p>The two discuss Gally’s new stage name of Midnight, agreeing that it is better suited than Nightingale given Gally’s low voice.
      This gives Newt <a href="/for-a-tale-of/woof-woof-woof/starting-from-the-beginning">an idea for a song</a> in which Gally would play the part of a man who impersonates birds.</p>

      He remarks that there are other ways of achieving the same effect.</p><p>At this point, Gally begins to speak more plainly.
      She had particularly hoped that Newt would do this for them, so that the kid would be the closest possible thing to being Gally’s own child.</p><p>This convinces Newt and they agree to the plan. He asks to be part of the child’s life in the role of an uncle.</p><p>Gally begins to explain the practicalities of the arrangement by asking if Newt knows Crewe.</p>
